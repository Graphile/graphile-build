/*
 * Originally we tried this with a CTE, but:

 * > The sub-statements in WITH are executed concurrently with each other and
 * > with the main query. Therefore, when using data-modifying statements in
 * > WITH, the order in which the specified updates actually happen is
 * > unpredictable. All the statements are executed with the same snapshot (see
 * > Chapter 13), so they cannot "see" one another's effects on the target
 * > tables. This alleviates the effects of the unpredictability of the actual
 * > order of row updates, and means that RETURNING data is the only way to
 * > communicate changes between different WITH sub-statements and the main

 *
 * This caused issues with computed columns that themselves went off and
 * performed selects - because the data within those selects used the old
 * snapshot and thus returned stale data.
 *
 * To solve this, we tried using temporary tables to ensure the mutation and
 * the select execute in different statments. This worked, but temporary tables
 * require elevated priviliges and thus don't work everywhere. We needed a more
 * generic solution.
 *
 * In the end we settled for sending the data we received from the mutations
 * straight back into the PostgreSQL server. It's a bit wasteful but it works.
 *
 * If you can come up with a better solution please open a pull request!
